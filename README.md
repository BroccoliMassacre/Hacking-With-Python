Python Scripting for automating VAPT Test Cases

This git is a list of the self-created python scripts that automate some of the test cases for a VAPT assignment. 
Some of them are as basic as just running an NMAP scan and some of them can be much more complex than that. The goal is to learn and apply for practical purposes.
